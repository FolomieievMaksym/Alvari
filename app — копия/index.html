									<h4 class="benefits__title">DERIVATIVE TRADING</h4>
									<p class="benefits__text text">Our Alvari Group uses derivative instruments to manage the fluctuations inherent to commodity trading. Continuing the theme of stability, we integrate risk management on a micro level, not purely macro: trading desks operate within centrally determined parameters and we hedge market prices via futures or swaps. Always supported by rigorous data collection, analysis and distribution, we’re able to keenly monitor markets, mitigating risks
										and
										identifying opportunities.</p>

									<p class="benefits__text text">We get commodities where they need to go! With safe and efficient storage and logistics, we use the latest technology to ensure efficacy as well as the utmost safety standards for the environment and our personnel. Geographically strategic depots give us access to the Asian, Middle Eastern and European markets, so we can get the right grade product - blended to match the customer’s specifications – to them by barge, rail, pipe and vessel.

								<p>As one of the leading VGO and FO exporters in Kazakhstan, we buy oil products from all three main refineries located in Atyrau, Pavlodar and Shymkent as well as the majority of the output of smaller refineries in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. To synergise with this production, we applied our vision of stable yet agile networks, establishing strong, durable relationships with the largest freight forwarding companies in Russia and Georgia, as well securing transhipment
									contracts with major marine
									terminals in those countries too. All of that, along with our cooperation with diverse renowned international traders creates a resilient operation that increases potential future export options exponentially.</p>
								<p>Further expansion and development are always just round the corner, the goal: adding additional strength and structure to our network.
